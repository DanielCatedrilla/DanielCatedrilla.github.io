            <h3>Who are we</h3>
            <p>Silverworks is the leading retailer of sterling silver jewelry in the Philippines. It aims to be the primary source of high-quality and innovative jewelry in the Philippines. It started as a retailer of sterling silver accessories and evolved to providing affordable but still fashionable jewelry made of stainless steel, tungsten and titanium. <br><br>

                As a brand, we have gained the loyalty, trust, and the esteem of our customers and consumers. People are proud to wear our products simply because it is SilverWorks. Our consumers have chosen us to be part of their special moments which became our own story. <br><br>
                
                Our pieces are statement jewelry and expressions of emotions and personal character and due to this, the brand has evolved. We now carry tungsten with diamonds, titanium, stainless steel, charms, and skin jewelry. There is no telling where we can expand next because as long as stylistic expression exists, the brand will be there as that is its essence. <br><br>
                
                Thus, The New SW.
